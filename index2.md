## *So, what does the model do?*
##### The model is an agent-based model, which contains 3 basic elements:
#### **Model** code, which sets up the model, interacts with the user, and runs the model iterations and checks the stopping conditions.
#### **Agent** code, which builds agents, defines their behaviour, and any records of their state. Agents often have behaviours based around what is happening in the neighbourhood in which they are contained. Each agent will contain a list of all the other agents, so that agents can communicate with each other.
#### **Environment** code, which represents the 'world' in which agents interact. This contains data as well as constraint the space and topology the agents can exist within.

## *What can I expect when I run the model?
